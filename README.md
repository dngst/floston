Propery owners or caretakers can create accounts for tenants. Tenants can sign in
to to view their account details including next rent payment and ammount due.
Tenants can also submit requests and view articles written by the admin.

Requests can be about needed repairs, disturbance from a neighbour or inquiry.
Articles written by the admin can be about an onboarding checklist for new
tenants, key people in relation to the property, property rules, routines; garbage
collection and key areas on the property.
